Java Script Variables

Dynamically typed language - can change assigned value from one type to another type in runtime. like int to string.

let a =67;
console.log(a);

a = "sanjay";

console.log(a);
</code>

He it will work and print 67 and sanjay.

### Rules for choosing variable names
- variables are case sensitive
- variable must begin with $, underscore or a letter.
- variable can also have digits but can not be at the beginning
- Reserved key words can't be used.

### Video 3: var let vs const

var was used pre es6, should avoid using this.
- var is globally scoped while let & const are block scoped
- var can be updated & re-declared within its scope.
- let can be updated but not redeclared
- const can neither be updated nor be re-declared.
- var variables are initialized with undefined where as let and const variable are not initialized.
- const must be initialized during declaration unlike let and var.
